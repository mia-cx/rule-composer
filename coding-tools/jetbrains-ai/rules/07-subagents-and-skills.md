# Subagents and Skills

**Skills** (`.junie/`) — Repeatable workflows. When implementing a plan, use skills referenced in the plan (e.g. vitest-writer for tests, quartz-docs-author for docs). Create or update a skill when the work produces a new multi-step workflow worth reusing.

Keep this rule short; see [Rules and Skills](06-rules-and-skills.mdc) for when to create rules vs skills and for global promotion.
