# Rules and Skills

**Rules** (`.claude/rules/*.md`) — For project knowledge: architecture decisions, conventions, patterns, gotchas. One concern per file, under 50 lines. Use `alwaysApply: true` for project-wide context, `globs` for file-scoped patterns. Include "do / don't" examples for coding patterns.

**Proactive creation:** When you discover an architectural decision, debug a non-obvious gotcha, or build a repeatable workflow — write a rule or skill for it immediately. Don't ask.
