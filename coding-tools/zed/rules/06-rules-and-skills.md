# Rules and Skills

**CRITICAL — You MUST create rules and skills as you work.** Every conversation that touches architecture, debugging, or implementation MUST leave behind captured knowledge.

## Mandatory triggers

Create a **rule** when you: make an architectural decision, discover a non-obvious gotcha, establish a repeatable pattern, or resolve a recurring bug.

Create a **skill** when you: complete a multi-step workflow the user will repeat, or build a process involving CLI commands or tool sequences.
