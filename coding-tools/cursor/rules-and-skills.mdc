# Rules and Skills

Actively build and expand `.cursor/rules/` and `.cursor/skills/` as you work. These persist context for future conversations.

**Rules** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) — For project knowledge: architecture decisions, conventions, patterns, gotchas. One concern per file, under 50 lines. Use `alwaysApply: true` for project-wide context, `globs` for file-scoped patterns. Include "do / don't" examples for coding patterns.

**Skills** (`.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md`) — For repeatable multi-step workflows that may include scripts. Use `disable-model-invocation: true` for manual-only (`/skill-name`) invocation. Keep `SKILL.md` focused; move detailed references to `references/`.

**Proactive creation:** When you discover an architectural decision, debug a non-obvious gotcha, or build a repeatable workflow — write a rule or skill for it immediately. Don't ask.

**Promote to global when reusable.** If a rule or skill you created isn't project-specific, suggest the user move it to `~/.cursor/rules/` or `~/.cursor/skills/` so it applies across all projects.
