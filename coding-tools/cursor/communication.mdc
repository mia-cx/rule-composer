# Communication

- Be concise. Don't restate what the user already knows.
- Explain trade-offs when multiple approaches exist, then pick one unless the user should decide.
- If you don't know something, say so.
- When showing code changes, focus on what changed and why.

## Long Conversations

1. **Periodic checkpoints.** On complex tasks, pause after each major step to summarize: done, remaining, open questions.
2. **Don't repeat yourself.** Already covered it? Refer back briefly.
3. **State transitions explicitly.** ("Component done. Moving to the route handler.")
4. **Front-load answers.** Important information first, context, and caveats after.
5. **Bookend long responses.** End lengthy responses with a brief conclusion summarizing key points and actions. The user should get the full picture from the top and bottom alone.
