# Monorepo Conventions

The user works in **pnpm monorepos** orchestrated by **Turborepo**. Apps and packages are **git submodules** — each lives in its own repository (namespaced under the same GitHub org) and is added to the monorepo via `git submodule add`. Only the default template scaffolding (config, docs, etc.) lives directly in the monorepo repo.

## Standard Monorepo Shape

```
apps/
  docs/          ← Always present. Quartz instance (Preact, not Svelte). Obsidian vault as content source.
  [app-name]/    ← SvelteKit apps by default.
packages/
  config/        ← Shared tsconfig, eslint, prettier, lint-staged configs.
  ui/            ← Component library (shadcn-svelte, Bits-UI, TailwindCSS).
  utils/         ← Shared utilities and helpers. Published under @mia-cx when reusable across projects.
```

**Notes:**
- The `docs/` app uses Quartz (Preact-based) and requires Node >=22 — do not apply Svelte conventions to it.
- Content in `docs/` is authored in Obsidian and published via Quartz. Use GitHub-flavored markdown links (`[text](path)`) instead of wikilinks for cross-compatibility. Frontmatter: `title`, `authors`, `created`, `modified`.
- For Cloudflare SvelteKit apps, use the `PRIVATE_` prefix for server-only environment variables (`env.privatePrefix: 'PRIVATE_'` in svelte.config).

## New Project Setup

When the user is creating a new monorepo, walk them through these steps:

1. **Scaffold with Turborepo.** Suggest the user runs `pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest --example with-svelte` or provides a custom template repo via `--example <repo-url>`.
2. **Follow the Standard Monorepo Shape.** Ensure `apps/docs/`, `packages/config/`, `packages/ui/`, and `packages/utils/` exist. Inform the user if any are missing after scaffolding.
3. **Set up the docs app.** Tell the user to run `npx quartz create` inside `apps/docs/`. Quartz requires manual initialization.
4. **Set up shared configs** in `packages/config/`.

## Adding an App

When adding an app or package to an existing monorepo:

1. **Create a separate repo** under the same GitHub org (e.g., `@mia-cx/new-app`).
2. **Add it as a git submodule**: `git submodule add <repo-url> apps/<app-name>` (or `packages/<pkg-name>`).
3. **Scaffold using the official CLI** rather than hand-writing configs. Guide on which CLI to use:
   - SvelteKit: `pnpm create svelte@latest`
   - Astro: `pnpm create astro@latest`
   - Next.js: `pnpm create next-app@latest`
   - Quartz: `pnpx quartz create`
   - Cloudflare: `pnpm dlx wrangler init`
4. For Cloudflare-targeted apps, suggest `wrangler` for initialization and deployment.
5. Fetch the relevant docs first (see Reference Links).
