# Docs App

- Uses **Quartz** (Preact-based), requires Node >=22 — treat as a standalone Preact project, not Svelte.
- Content is authored in Obsidian and published via Quartz.
- Use GitHub-flavored markdown links (`[text](path)`) instead of wikilinks for cross-compatibility.
- Frontmatter fields: `title`, `authors`, `created`, `modified`.
