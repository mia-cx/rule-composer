# .mdc Frontmatter Conventions

Every `.mdc` rule file must have valid YAML frontmatter with these fields:

## Required fields

- `description` — One-line summary of what the rule covers
- `alwaysApply` — Explicit boolean. `true` for project-wide rules (no globs), `false` for scoped rules (with globs)

## Optional fields

- `globs` — File patterns that trigger the rule. Unquoted, never wrapped in `"..."` or `[...]`
  - Single: `globs: scripts/**/*.ts`
  - Multiple: `globs: scripts/shared/formats.ts, scripts/decompose/index.ts`

## Rules

- Every rule with `globs` must set `alwaysApply: false`
- Every rule without `globs` must set `alwaysApply: true`
- Glob values are always unquoted — quotes cause literal matching, not pattern matching
- Multiple globs use comma-separated values, not YAML arrays — `[...]` syntax does not parse correctly
- Glob patterns starting with `*` (e.g., `**/*.mdc`) are invalid YAML (`*` is a YAML alias character). Cursor handles them natively, but `gray-matter` will crash. The CLI pre-quotes these via `quoteGlobs()` before parsing.
