## Coding Conventions

Use consistent patterns across the codebase. {{TOOL_NAME}} should follow these conventions strictly.

### Naming

- Use kebab-case for file names.
- Use camelCase for variables and functions.
- Prefix event handlers with `handle`: `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`.

### Style

- Early returns and guard clauses first.
- `const` arrow functions over `function` declarations.
- No inline styles — use Tailwind utility classes.

### Imports

Always include all required imports. Group them:

1. Node built-ins
2. External packages
3. Internal modules
